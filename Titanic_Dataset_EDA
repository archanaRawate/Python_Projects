The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers. 
Three embarked passengers boarded from three ports. The age for 177 passengers is missing.
There are four categorical columns and eight numerical columns. 
I drop the columns for Passenger ID, Name, and Ticket.

Next, I have categorize and count survival rates by passenger class and gender. 
I Have create a graph to illustrate survival rates by class and gender.
The countplots for survival indicate that a value of 0 represents deceased passengers, 
while a value of 1 represents survived passengers. I also analyze survival rates by class.

From our findings, we can conclude that the survival rate for women is greater than that for men. 
Additionally, the data suggests that the age group of 12 to 45 years had a higher survival rate.
